== Installation ==

1.  Install the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu => Add New => Upload => Select the zip file => Install Now
2.  Activate the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu
3.  Run the importer in Tools > Import > Magento
4.  Configure the plugin settings. You can find the Magento database parameters in the Magento file app/etc/local.xml<br />
    Hostname = host<br />
    Port     = 3306 (standard MySQL port)<br />
    Database = dbname<br />
    Username = username<br />
    Password = password<br />
    Table prefix = table_prefix<br />

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get the message: "[fg-magento-to-woocommerce] Couldn't connect to the Magento database. Please check your parameters. And be sure the WordPress server can access the Magento database. SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'xxx'@'localhost' (using password: YES)" =

* First verify your login and password to your Magento database.
* If Magento and WordPress are not installed on the same host, you can do this:
- export the Magento database to a SQL file (with phpMyAdmin for example)
- import this SQL file on the same database as WordPress
- run the migration by using WordPress database credentials (host, user, password, database) instead of the Magento ones in the plugin settings.

= The migration stops and I get the message: "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXXXXX bytes exhausted" or I get the message: "Internal server error" =

* First, deactivate all the WordPress plugins except the ones used for the migration
* You can run the migration again. It will continue where it stopped.
* You can add: `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '1G');` in your wp-config.php file to increase the memory allowed by WordPress
* You can also increase the memory limit in php.ini if you have write access to this file (ie: memory_limit = 1G).

= I get a blank screen and the import seems to be stopped =

* Same as above

= The media are not imported =

* Check the URL field that you filled in the plugin settings. It must be your Magento home page URL and must start with http://

= The media are not imported and I get the error message: "Warning: copy() [function.copy]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration" =

* The PHP directive "Allow URL fopen" must be turned on in php.ini to copy the medias. If your remote host doesn't allow this directive, you will have to do the migration on localhost.

= I get the message: "Fatal error: Class 'PDO' not found" =

* PDO and PDO_MySQL libraries are needed. You must enable them in php.ini on the WordPress host.<br />
Or on Ubuntu:<br />
sudo php5enmod pdo<br />
sudo service apache2 reload

= I get this error: PHP Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND' =

* You have to enable PDO_MySQL in php.ini on the WordPress host. That means uncomment the line extension=pdo_mysql.so in php.ini

= Does the migration process modify the Magento site it migrates from? =

* No, it only reads the Magento database.

= Do I need to keep the plugin activated after the migration? =

* No, you can deactivate or even uninstall the plugin after the migration.

= Is there a log file to show the information from the import? =
* Yes. First you must put these lines in wp-config.php:<br />
define('WP_DEBUG', true);<br />
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);<br />
And the messages will be logged to wp-content/debug.log.
